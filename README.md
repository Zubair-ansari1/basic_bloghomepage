Hey Geeks I am glad and happpy to share my first HTML & CSS project , I made this this with my own and without any online help.
It contains a home, contact and about page.
I tried my best!!!

The HTML skeleton made my be has many errors or I used wrond tags , I know but i will not used h4,h2,h3 tage everywhere as it is was my first project that's the reason i used wrong tags, but  I will improve myself.
