Hey Geeks I am glad and happpy to share my first HTML & CSS project , I made this this with my own and without any online help.
It contains a home, contact and about page.
I tried my best!!!

The HTML skeleton made my be has some errors or maybe I used wrong tags somewhere, it was my first project that's the reason it has some issue like responsiveness of footer,etc.But  I will improve myself.
